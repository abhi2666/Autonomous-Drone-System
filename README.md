# Autonomous-Drone-System
Automated drone system Ardupilot and Dronekit capable of performing various feats.
-> The Project features an autopilot / simulator that uses Ardupilot at its core. But if you have the right set of components, then you can try it directly on your drone.
-> Simulator provides a safe way of testing the drone and the tension of breaking expensive parts will be no more.

NOTE -> If you are want to try this code for yourself, then please contact at gairolaabhishek26@gmail.com because the setup is not easy !

Features - 
1. Drone Delivery - capable of performing drone delivery where it starts from your home location and then go to your desired location. You have the freedom of choosing the altitude and target location and based of that the drone will take the shortest path. 

NOTE - Since its a simulation, the drone does not perform any object detection and object avoidance, but if you have an actual camera drone then you can add the required extra lines of code to make object detection and avoidance drone. You will need some extra sensors like lidar.

2. surveillance - perform surveillance of marked area and hovering over certain fixed points (geo location) and then performing designated manuvers. Can cover larger or smaller area.
Can be enhanced easily by using a good camera and multiple drones at the same time.

NOTE - you need GPS enabled drone to perfrom both the tasks because that is how the drone will keep track of its location with respect to target location.
